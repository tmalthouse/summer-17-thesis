  abstract={The majority of massive disk galaxies, including our own, have stellar bars with vertically thick inner region, known as “boxy/peanut-shaped” (B/P) bulges. The most commonly suggested mechanism for the formation of B/P bulges is a violent vertical “buckling” instability in the bar, something that has been seen in N -body simulations for over 20 years, but never identified in real galaxies. Here, we present the first direct observational evidence for ongoing buckling in two nearby galaxies (NGC 3227 and NGC 4569), including characteristic asymmetric isophotes and (in NGC 4569) stellar kinematic asymmetries that match buckling in simulations. This confirms that the buckling instability takes place and produces B/P bulges in real galaxies. A toy model of bar evolution yields a local fraction of buckling bars consistent with observations if the buckling phase lasts ∼0.5–1 Gyr, in agreement with simulations.}

  abstract={We have determined the fraction of barred galaxies in the H -band for a statistically well-defined sample of 186 spirals drawn from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. We find 56% of our sample to be strongly barred in the H band while another 16% is weakly barred. Only 27% of our sample is unbarred in the near-infrared. The RC3 and the Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies both classify only about 30% of our sample as strongly barred. Thus strong bars are nearly twice as prevalent in the near-infrared as in the optical. The frequency of genuine optically hidden bars is significant but lower than many claims in the literature: 40% of the galaxies in our sample that are classified as unbarred in the RC3 show evidence for a bar in the H band while the Carnegie Atlas lists this fraction as 66%. Our data reveal no significant trend in bar fraction as a function of morphology in either the optical or H band. Optical surveys of high-redshift galaxies may be strongly biased against finding bars, as bars are increasingly difficult to detect at bluer rest wavelengths.}

  abstract={We have carried out a synthetic spectral analysis of a Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observation of the old nova DI Lacertae (Nova Lacerta 1910). The spectrum, obtained with the E140M disperser, reveals a rising continuum shortward of 1560 Å, a C IV P Cygni profile indicative of wind outflow associated with disk accretion, a deep Lyα profile, and strong N V (1238 and 1242 Å) and O V (1371 Å) wind/coronal absorption lines. Numerous sharp interstellar resonance lines are also present. A grid of accretion disk models, spanning a wide range of inclinations, accretion rates, and white dwarf masses, was compared with three sets of dereddened data. From the three best fits, we conclude that the most likely parameters characterizing the far-UV spectrum of DI Lac are an inclination below 18°, a white dwarf mass between 0.6 and 0.8 M ⊙ , and an accretion rate between 10 -9.0 and 10 -9.5 M ⊙ yr -1 . The scale factors for the three best-fit disk models indicate distances between 2 and 2.5 kpc. The extreme weakness or absence of silicon features in the observed spectrum corresponds to a silicon underabundance of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 10 -4 times solar. The best-fitting high-gravity photosphere model has log g = 8, T eff = 27,000 K, V sin i = 200 km s -1 , and a scale factor distance (for a 0.7 M ⊙ white dwarf) of only 76 pc. Thus, a white dwarf photosphere cannot be contributing appreciably to the far-UV spectrum.}
