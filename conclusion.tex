\emph{The process by which the structure and dynamics of the MW were discovered was by no means trivial: Linblad [ref.] was a hero along with the other pioneers.

\section{More info}
And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head \emph{shouldn't be} indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.
