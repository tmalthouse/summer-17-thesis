# Summer 2017 Thesis Project
#### Thomas Malthouse

This is a thesis about the evolution of galaxies and the formation of bars in spiral galaxies like our own.

It is written in LaTeX, using the `subfiles` package to move each chapter into a separate file. This speeds up compilation and makes it much easier to write, since the content is separated from the formatting and preamble boilerplate.

### File Listing
* `thesis.tex` is the main file, which contains the preamble and formatting options.
* `introduction.tex` explains the project and various important cosmological concepts needed to understand the project.
* `optimizations.tex` details the computation techniques used in this project and the rationale behind them.
